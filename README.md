🐳 Docker Implementation

The project uses Docker for full containerization of all services.

Backend Docker Image
docker build -t app-translator-backend .
Frontend Docker Image
docker build -t app-translator-frontend .
🐙 Docker Compose

Docker Compose was used for:

Local development
Integration testing
Multi-container orchestration
Run Full Application
docker compose up -d
Run Test Environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

The application was deployed to Kubernetes using:

Deployments
Services
StatefulSets
ConfigMaps
Secrets
Persistent Volumes
Ingress
📦 Kubernetes Components
Component	Purpose
Deployment	Stateless application management
StatefulSet	Persistent PostgreSQL storage
Service	Internal networking
ConfigMap	Database configuration
Secret	Sensitive credentials
PVC	Persistent database storage
Ingress	External access routing
🌐 Kubernetes Networking

Ingress NGINX was used to expose the application externally.

Example Routing
Path	Destination
/	Frontend
/api	Backend API
🗄️ PostgreSQL Persistence

The database uses:

Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
StatefulSets

This ensures data survives pod restarts and redeployments.

🔐 Secrets Management

The project implements secure secret management using:

Kubernetes Secrets
Bitnami Sealed Secrets
Why Sealed Secrets?

Regular Kubernetes Secrets are only Base64 encoded.

Sealed Secrets provide encrypted secrets safe for Git repositories.

📦 Helm Chart Deployment

The Kubernetes manifests were migrated into a reusable Helm Chart.

Helm Features
Centralized configuration
Reusable templates
Easier upgrades
Dynamic values management
Production-ready deployment process
Helm Installation
helm install app-translator ./helm
Helm Upgrade
helm upgrade app-translator ./helm

🔄 CI/CD Pipelines

The project includes two separate production-style CI/CD pipelines:

Backend Pipeline
Frontend Pipeline

Implemented using GitHub Actions.

🧪 Backend CI/CD Pipeline

The backend pipeline includes:

✔ Unit Tests
npm test
✔ Docker Build Validation
docker build
✔ Integration Tests

Integration tests run using:

docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
✔ DockerHub Push

Images are pushed automatically with:

latest tag
Git SHA tag
✔ EC2 Deployment

Automatic deployment to AWS EC2 using SSH.

☁️ Frontend CI/CD Pipeline

The frontend pipeline includes:

✔ Frontend Validation

Basic frontend verification stage.

✔ AWS OIDC Authentication

Secure temporary AWS authentication without static access keys.

✔ S3 Deployment

Frontend files are automatically deployed to AWS S3.

✔ CloudFront Cache Invalidation

Automatic CDN cache clearing after deployment.

☁️ AWS Services Used
AWS Service	Purpose
EC2	Backend deployment
S3	Static frontend hosting
CloudFront	CDN distribution
IAM OIDC	Secure GitHub authentication
🧪 Testing Strategy

The project includes:

Test Type	Purpose
Unit Tests	Backend functionality
Integration Tests	Multi-service validation
Docker Validation	Container verification
Health Checks	Kubernetes readiness
❤️ Kubernetes Health Checks
